5.What is a controller in web development, and what is its role in the MVC architecture?
ans: In web development, a controller is a component that handles user requests and manages the flow of data within the
    Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. It receives input from the user, interacts with the model to fetch or modify data,
    and selects the appropriate view to present the response back to the user. The controller acts as the intermediary 
    between the user interface and the underlying data and business logic.
